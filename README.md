# Cinema App
Android demo application for cinema ticket reservation.  

## Getting started
CinemaApp provides the posibility to `reserve` tickets for movies fast and efficiently.  
It also saves you time by replacing long lines with an `in-app integrated ticket`.

* Data persistence
* REST API for fetching movie data
